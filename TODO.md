## Things to do for Seasonal

- Scheduled bot that will remove all rank roles and then add slacker to everyone
- In the above script, make a seasonal leaderboard and post into grind-finale
- contains a seasonal json file that will increase by 1 after each season



- Make customized messages for level up for everyone (should I make it embeds?)
- Make all rank ID's back to grindtime rank Id
- Announce customized rank up messaged into annoucements
