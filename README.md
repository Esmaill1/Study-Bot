<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Because of the quarantine and the growing popularity of online learning, I found myself lonely and unmotivated to study. Therefore, I decided to create a studying community known as **Grind Time**. With that, different ideas started to pop into my head on not only how to motivate myself but motivate others to study.

1. It began with a **levelling system** where the more hours you study in the *Grind Time* voice channel, the higher your level / rank.
    - incentivizing focused studying
    - ![ranks image](img/image0.png)
2. Then came the **streak system** where each day you study, you increase your streak. However, you have to be in the voice channel for at least 12 minutes for it to update.
    - incentivizing consistency
    - ![streaks image](img/image1.png)
3. Next came the **leaderboards**. You could now pit yourself against others in the server. See your rank and hours studied compared to others!

5. Then popped the **grind profile**. A profile which displays your rank, hours studied, streaks, etc. all into one neat profile card individualized for each member.

7. Finally, I decided to implement **automated leaderboard posts** where each week, month, and season, the top 20 members of the server gets recognized for their achievements.

### Built With

Javascript, Discord.js, Node

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage - [Join the server](https://discord.gg/QxeTD6V86F)

3. That's pretty much it. You can explore the server, but everything else is pretty much automated! Don't be shy to talk or ask me anything. I'm there everyday!

### File Explanations - Skip if not interested
- `index.js` contains the main bulk of the functionality. It houses the time tracker, streaks, and role adding / removing. 
- `scheduled/` contains different files that are run at certain time intervals
    - `daily-instrucions.js`: will post daily instructions in different channels in case members forget commands
    - `monthly-leaderboard.js`: will post the top 20 grinders and their hours at the end of each month
    - `weekly-leaderboard.js`: will post the top 20 grinders and their hours at the end of each week
    - `seasonal/seasonal-leaderboard.js`: will post the top 20 grinders and their hours at the end of each season 
    - `QOTD/QOTD.js`: each day, it will post a question and quote of the day.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

I have a lot of ideas for this project, gamifying it even more, however this is the current finished build. Currently I am studying Python, and since the project is mainly in Javascript, I will revisit this project once I go back to learning Javascript.

- Some Future Ideas:
    1. Making a shop
    2. Making a story that unlocks after each rank
    3. Hidden ranks / special classes
    4. Making your own character
